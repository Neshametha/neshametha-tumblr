# Neshametha Tumblr Theme
A repository for my current Tumblr layout.

*Unfortunately, with how Tumblr theme customization works, I have to cram the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into a single file. In my experience, this isnâ€™t the best practice, but I am just complying with how the site works.*

This theme features 3 columns of posts. It is able to display Tumblr posts of any kind. It also features endless scrolling rather than manual pagination.

In the bottom left is a Pantone swatch created in HTML for the color 11-4805 TCX, also known as "Hint of Mint." When hovering over the swatch, it changes to the color 15-5416 TCX, also known as "Florida Keys." To the immediate right of the swatch are buttons for navigation around the site.
